# Data-Journalism

- Background

  Welcome to the newsroom! You've just accepted a data visualization position for a major metro paper. You're tasked with analyzing the current trends shaping people's lives, as well as creating charts, graphs, and interactive elements to help readers understand your findings.

  The editor wants to run a series of feature stories about the health risks facing particular demographics. She's counting on you to sniff out the first story idea by sifting through the latest information from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System.

  The beat reporters will go out and investigate the relationship you find, sourcing experts and finding anecdotes to back up your research. That's tough work, and they won't be happy about digging for a story that doesn't exist—you'll need to find a convincing correlation before you even think about pitching your first article. The editor also wants you to make a scatter plot to show the correlation—you are the data visualizer, after all.
